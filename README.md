I wanted to learn Dash and so started playing around with it. All data used is publicly available from various open datasets including:

- [Data SD](https://data.sandiego.gov/)
- [California Department of Education](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/si/ds/pubschls.asp)
- [San Diego Housing Commission](https://www.sdhc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Affordable-Housing-Resource-Guide.pdf)

I had to scrape and geocode some of the data.
